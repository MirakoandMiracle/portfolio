          <p class="border p-3">
            Hello there! My name is May Zin Phoo. You can call me "May". I am a
            22-year-old woman from Myanmar who loves to learn new things.
            Previously, I was studying Medical Laboratory Technology at
            university, but due to political issues, I had to take a break.
            However, during this time, I discovered my passion for web
            development and my goal now is to become a full stack developer. I
            am excited to pursue this path and continue expanding my knowledge
            in the field.
          </p>
          <h5 class="btn-pink p-2 text-center">Hobbies and interests</h5>
          <p class="border p-3">
            Writing and reading have always been my passions, and I have written
            numerous novels and short stories. Music is another interest of
            mine, and I am currently exploring avenues such as blogging and
            vlogging to share my experiences and ideas with others.
